# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to

# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named `.env`
# and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional env variables, the schema in /env/schema.mjs
# should be updated accordingly
